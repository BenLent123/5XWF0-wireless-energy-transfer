DONE
- mppt
- load detection (somewhat)
- over current / voltage protection
- dynamic PWM
- adc measurements
- code flow
- sysinit / setup
- load detection --> needs testing


TO CHECK!
- MPPT --> maybe P and O instead of Incremental conductance
- CHECK DEADTIME



load detection via dcac / if load detected then flag pin on dcdc ! dcdc conv = 0 dutycycle during load detection
