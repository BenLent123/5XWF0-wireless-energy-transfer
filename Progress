CURRENT task for 30.05.2024

- test ADC and PWM custom 
- test MPPT algo ??
- make load detection
-seperate c and h files for PWM/ADC/ALGO (HALFWAY)
- finish main function

TALK about:
- need for 6 ADC pins
- TA recommends 4 
- DCAC ouput pins dont add anything beyond losses of DCAC --> "overkill"
- load detection --> alot of current draw from second coil when it works can be seen inbetween DCDC/DCAC
